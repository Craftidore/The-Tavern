# The-Tavern

Craftidore's Tavern! 
This will be the home of more generic TTRPG resources and knowledge. 
Currently it's a massive WIP.

## HALP! The Folder Names Are Confusing

I decided to go with 'fun' tavern-related folder names for the top-level directories. 
Don't worry, the rest of the folders are named normally.
Here's a key for the rest:

- 00-Behind-The-Bar
    - Any meta information about the vault goes here, like an index of folders.
    - Attachments/Templater scripts & generally things that make the vault work go here.
- 10-The-Bar
    - I'm not sure, I just liked the name.
- 20-Bathroom-Library
    - Other resources, summaries thereof, guides, etc.
- 30-Quest-Board
    - Adventure inspiration
