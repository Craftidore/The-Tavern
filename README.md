# The-Tavern

Craftidore's Tavern! 
This will be the home of more generic TTRPG resources and knowledge. 
Currently it's a massive WIP.

## HALP! The Folder Names Are Confusing

I decided to go with 'fun' tavern-related folder names for the top-level directories. 
Don't worry, the rest of the folders are named normally.
Here's a key for the rest:

- [[00-Behind-The-Bar]]
    - Any meta information about the vault goes here, like an index of folders.
    - Attachments/Templater scripts & generally things that make the vault work go here.
- [[10-The-Bar]]
    - One-stop shop for finding things; here lies [[Help-whats-an-MoC|MoCs]] and various reference material not worthy of a note in the [[20-Bathroom-Library|Bathroom Library]].
- [[20-Bathroom-Library]]
    - Other resources, summaries thereof, guides, etc.
- [[30-Quest-Board]]
