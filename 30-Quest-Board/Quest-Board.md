There's a human in the corner sipping on a strange liquid with shifting color from a stranger looking iron flask decorated with colorful braided threads. Behind him rests a large wooden board with various pieces of notices; one written on a parchment with rich blue black ink with a intricate seal, a torn leather piece with notice written in dried blood and a wanted poster. 
"Looking for some extra coins in your pockets or just something to kill time with?" The human chuckles and strums the table with his fingers. "If you fancy some coins while you are waiting for your companions to finish their business, here's one about slaying a beast that's terrorizing local village. If slaying isn't your thing, a merchant over there is looking for someone to protect him from highwaymen and beasts during his travel to the next village." The man scans your outfit and fixates on the weapon on your waist.
"Perhaps the mundane things of this world isn't really for you eh? I might have something... extra-ordinary requests from more peculiar part of the realms if you are... courageous or crazy enough to hop in." The man chuckles gestures his left, a thin black flowing curtain peppered with white specs resembling a night sky. Upon close inspection the specs twinkled like stars. 
"Not the curtain, the thing behind the curtain." The man stands up to slightly reveal what is behind the curtain, small office with many rooms surrounding it.
