# Introduction 
There's a human in the corner of the tavern sipping his drink from a strange looking iron flask decorated with colorful braided threads. Behind him rests a large wooden board with various pieces of notices; one written on a parchment with rich blue black ink with a intricate seal, a torn leather piece with notice written in dried blood and a wanted poster. 

"Looking for some extra coins in your pockets or just something to kill time with?" The human chuckles and strums the table with his fingers. "If you fancy some coins while you are waiting for your companions to finish their business, here's one about slaying a beast that's terrorizing local village. If slaying isn't your thing, a merchant over there is looking for someone to protect him from highwaymen and beasts during his travel to the next village." The man scans your outfit and fixates on the weapon on your waist.

"Perhaps the mundane things of this world isn't really for you eh? I might have something... extra-ordinary requests from more peculiar part of the realms if you are... courageous or crazy enough to hop in." The man chuckles gestures his left, a thin black flowing curtain peppered with white specs resembling a night sky. Upon close inspection the specs twinkled like stars. 

"Not the curtain, the thing behind the curtain." The man stands up to slightly reveal a small office with many doors comes to view. As you walk through the curtain, the man follows behind you. 

"Welcome to Jethoof's Emporium of Quests." He bows gracefully, here are some of the requests from the multiverse looking for brave traveler like yourself to solve their conundrums. They are willing to reward you handsomely should you solve their troubles.  Feel free to examine the doors, they come with description of their woes. To accept the request, you just simply enter."

# Quest Board
I know you have the big idea of heroes saving the world from certain doom and sometimes there can be some event the heroes stumble upon during their journey. Perhaps this is the main course for your campaign.  There are many reference books out there you can use to draw inspiration from and this is my method of generating events. These can be used for you to generate the main, sub and side plots when you feel you are stuck. 

[[Quest Table]] is my go to table when I want or need some inspiration on what kind of elements to use. It is left vague for you to fill in the details since your world setting would be different from my world.

![[Quest Table#^dice1]]

I will provide some of the examples I have based on the result of the tables I have. Also feel free to expand the table on your own to make it more complicated. Which will be covered in [[Creating Complex Tables]]

> [!example]
> ### Botched Binding (Prompt: **Aid Event**)
> A dire bear, severely wounded, barreled through the woods and ambushed the party. Once defeated a ranger comes through, drenched in sweat and tired looking complains it was his catch and the party ruined his ritual of binding. He introduces himself as [name here], a spirit binder, and was in a middle of challenging the creature in a ritual of binding to become his spirit companion. The creature was already causing trouble in the nearby village and he thought it would have been fine as long as he was able to bind the creature's spirit under his command. 
> 
> Now the ritual has been disrupted, he demands the party to help him to bind another and it did cost him some pretty copper to boot. If the party agrees to help, he would mention there's a bigger prey that the nearby village might be helped from, a frost worm called the Cleaver. The ranger offers two things, 
> - A safe passage from the prying eyes of the Scarlet Boar 
> - Ritual of Binding is for Rangers homebrew spell.  

This side story was actually used in one of my campaign for a filler episode in between story arcs.

| Cold        |

## Challenge Rating
This is not the Challenge Rating from the D&D series but rather challenge rating of an encounter against the adventuring party, and is relative to their level. This is obviously relative set up but gives you some idea of how challenging the encounter should be. 

| dice:1d100 | Challenge Rating  |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| 1-5      | Very Easy         |
| 6-20     | Easy              |
| 21-50    | Medium            |
| 51-80    | Hard              |
| 81-95    | Very Hard         |
| 96-100   | Nearly Impossible |

Let's combine all the tables together to generate an encounter for the adventuring party:

> [!error] Encounter Creator
> `dice:[[Quest-Board#^table4]]` `dice:[[Quest-Board#^table3]]` `dice:[[Quest-Board#^table1]]` `dice:[[Quest-Board#^table2]]` `dice:[[Quest-Board#^table2]]`(optional) 
^dice1
I got a Very Easy Huge Force Ooze with Dragon as an option. 

# Creating a Side Story
## Introduction
### In Medias Res
Means start from the middle, this could be used in several ways,
- The party is already in the middle of the action, after the encounter's over, you can narrate how they got here in the first place as a flashback.
> [!Example]-
> Prompt: Retrieve Item
> 
> Difficulty: Medium
> 
> The session opens up with the party running away from a tumbling boulder in a underground maze. The party enters a safe room after making some checks to avoid traps and the boulder. The party can take a break as you tell them how they have decided to retrieve a relic from a tomb of an ancient king and was paid in coins and equipment in advance and was promised for more payment if return with the item.

### TTRPG is in Essence, A Resource Management Game
Table Top RPG in a nutshell, a resource management game and you have to evoke that element to have the game engaging for the players. Knowing they have a journey ahead and until that mission is complete they cannot rest fully or resupplied gives tension to the players.

One thing that really helps is the set of time. The players will try to prepare themselves to the best or meander around too much before going to the main course. 

Limiting the time creates tension because they cannot have infinite abilities and spells. The way to create time limit is within the story. The rescuee will be executed at dawn. The party must find a safe place before the cavern floods with acid or competitors
