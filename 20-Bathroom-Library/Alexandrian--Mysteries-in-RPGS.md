Mysteries in RPGs are hard; after all the players aren't Sherlock Holmes.
The problem with mysteries is that there are *many* single points of failure&mdash;chokepoints where if the players **miss a single clue**, they **cannot solve the mystery** and the adventure comes **screeching to a halt**.

Some frequently given GM advice is to never let a **crucial clue** to the mystery **depend on a skill check**. 
Alexander proposes a better solution: redundancy.
For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, have [[Alexandrian--Three-Clue-Rule|at least 3 clues]] that each individually point them to it.

Note that each of these clues should point the PCs to the conclusion **on their own**. 
The Players shouldn't need more than 1 clue to figure the conclusion out, though having more clues can still make it easier.

## Final Tips

- Be permissive of people finding clues 
    - Default to giving them information when they look for it, even if you didn't *plan* for there to be a clue there
- Have Proactive Clues
    - Bash your PCs over the head with clues
    - If your PCs don't find a clue, have a clue find them
- Red Herrings are overrated
    - Use these only with extreme caution
    - Also, players will create their own Red Herrings
