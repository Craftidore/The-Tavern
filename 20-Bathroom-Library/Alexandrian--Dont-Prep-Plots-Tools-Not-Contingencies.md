This article expands upon [[Alexandrian--Dont-Prep-Plots]] by giving an actual example of a hospital heist, first going through what the prep would look like if it was prepped normally&mdash;as a plot with contingencies.
The prep is dense and would be very hard to use in-game; it is constantly going into what the PCs may do, but the organization makes it hard to find those sections in the middle of running the mission.

Worse, the prep assumes the PCs will follow a specific plan: infiltrate the hospital during the day, presumably disguised somehow.
It doesn't account for any other plans the PCs might have, like breaking in at night.

Alexander then proceeds to write up how *he* would prep for this. 
Instead of making assumptions about what the players might or might not do, he outlines the categories of obstacles that exist in the hospital (Nurses, Hospital Security, Donovan's Guards) and some important factors to remember about the PCs situation as a whole (the Knight may be watching their actions; what the reaction to the discovery that the PCs succeed in freeing the boys stuck in the hospital).

Alexander then goes into detail about what differentiates a tool from a contingency and what questions he asks himself. 
I can't do it justice in a summary and suggest you go read the article.
