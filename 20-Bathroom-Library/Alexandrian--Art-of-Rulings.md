Rulings, a fancy word for how things are decided further explicated in [[Alexandrian--Rules-vs-Rulings]], are frequently a subject of contention in RPGs. The heading of 'Rulings' covers whether player expertise can have any say over what happens in-game, as well as GM decisions about the world. This article goes over Justin's guiding principles in making rulings.

Justin has 3 guiding principles in his Art of Rulings:

> 1. Passive Observation of the world is automatically triggered.
> 2. Player expertise activates character expertise.
> 3. Player expertise can trump character expertise.

First, assume the players generally notice things. Sometimes this might require a successful check, but the player shouldn't have to ask if they, say, recognize the the family crest of an ornamental shield, the GM should just call for a roll if they might.  If someone's hiding in the bushes, the player shouldn't have to ask if someone is hiding in the bushes, the GM should call for a Spot check. "Passive Observation of the world is automatically triggered."

Secondly, the __role play__ in role playing game is important. Things that aren't passive *should* require an explicit statement of action. A character playing a rogue, is *role playing* the rogue; putting themselves in the shoes of the rogue. Part of playing the role of a rogue is **choosing** to do the things a rogue could do, like checking a chest for traps. Don't take this too far; the character in question *does have expertise*, so let them use that expertise. 
"Player expertise activates character expertise" (but it doesn't have to *replace* character expertise).

Finally, if a player makes a meaningful choice, you shouldn't take that choice away because it's not expertise that the character has. If you're playing a barbarian and you-the-player decide to explicitly check the bottom of a chest for hidden compartments, you should get some sort of circumstantial bonus to your check if that's where the hidden compartments are. 
If your barbarian smashes the chest open
