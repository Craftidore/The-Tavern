In this video Ginny Di goes over how The Battle of Karigarth, a one-shot set in the Celtic setting outlined in the [Vagabond's guide to Dalriada](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pennydragon/vagabonds-guide-to-dalriada?ref=6kf7ob),  builds tension among the players.
The one-shot itself is a fetch quest with 6 optional encounters between the players and the objective.
The encounters are optional so that the adventure can be scaled up and down in length based on your party's preferences.
With each encounter, the party makes *measurable* progress, which builds up to the climax. 

Beyond this, there are 3 tricks the adventure uses to build up tension:

1. Limits player info
    - Druid-summoned storm makes it difficult to scout ahead, and the party can't see more than 60 feet in any direction.
    - Party is deafened by an explosion right when they meet an ally and they can't hear what he's saying, but then combat starts.
2. Ticking clock
    - No need to actually time-limit the players, *but...*
    - Every time you can, remind players that *threat* is getting *closer/worse*, that they don't have much time, etc.
    - The illusion of a ticking clock changes how they problem solve.
3. Responsibility
    - In The Battle of Karigarth, the players are working to defend a city. They aren't alone, they're working with an army&mdash;they're part of a larger whole.
    - Remind the players of the consequences of their actions&mdash;who will be hurt by them.
    - Let the NPCs contribute (even if they have to contribute off-screen).

All these tips can help build tension (and stakes in general) in your games&mdash;stakes the players *feel* rather than just intellectually know.
