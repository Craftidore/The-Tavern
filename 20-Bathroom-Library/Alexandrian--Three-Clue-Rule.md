The 'Three Clue Rule' is a rule-of-thumb when writing mystery scenarios.
In books and movies, detectives find clues that lead to other clues, forming a linear breadcrumb trail.
This doesn't translate super-well to RPGs, because if the party misses one clue, they can't find the clues that come after, and they can't solve the mystery.
The three clue rule states that for every 'conclusion' the PCs should reach, there need to be 3 independent ways for them to reach this conclusionâ€”3 'clues.'

> Why three? Because the PCs will probably miss the first; ignore the second; and misinterpret the third before making some incredible leap of logic that gets them where you wanted them to go all along.

If you need your PCs to conclude the killer is a werewolf, have there be werewolf tracks outside in the snow (clue 1), the dead victim reaching for a silver knife when he died (clue 2) and have the neighbors report that they were kept up by a howling (clue 3). 
None of these clues depend on each other, and each could be used to get to the conclusion on their own.
It's not a guarantee that the PCs will figure out the conclusion, but it means the mystery is much less likely to grind to a halt when the PCs fail a search check.
