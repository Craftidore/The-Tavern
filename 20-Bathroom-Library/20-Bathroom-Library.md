# Bathroom Library

The Bathroom Library (the one safe spot to read in a tavern) contains write-ups and summaries about GMing resources, tips, tricks, etc.
The goal is to streamline the process of discovering similar resources; say you run into [[Alexandrian--Three-Clue-Rule|the three clue rule]] and want to see how it relates to other GMing advice, or have run [[Harper--Lady-Blackbird|Lady Blackbird]] and want to know about similar one-shots.
This vault is designed to be a place of discovery.
