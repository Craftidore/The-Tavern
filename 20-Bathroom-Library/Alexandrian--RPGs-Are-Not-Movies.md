We frequently use other forms of storytelling (books, movies, etc.) when talking about RPGs; they provide excellent examples of tropes & characters. 
However, there's an inherent trap in dong this: all these storytelling mediums are linear, where there's one path from start to finish.
In RPGs this is not the case, as the PCs have many *many* different directions they can go, ways the can accomplish goals, etc.
