Lady Blackbird is a one-shot designed by [[People--John-Harper]], creator of the famous [[Systems--Blades-In-The-Dark]].
It is free to download on [itch.io](https://johnharper.itch.io/lady-blackbird) and `=this.link`.

## Plot Summary

Lady Blackbird is set in small solar system with an atmosphere that allows airships to travel between planets.
Lady Blackbird and her body guard have hitched a ride on The Owl, a smuggling ship, in an attempt to find the lair of Lady Blackbird's lover, the pirate king Uriah Flint.
Unfortunately they were captured by the ship Hand of Sorrow.
Now they must escape the brig, and flee to the Remnants in search of Uriah, but what dangers will she and The Owl face along the way.

## Other Notes

Lady Blackbird is a one-shot built around the idea that the idea that the GM should not railroad the players. 
Beyond the opening description of what's happening, the GM is given *no* plot to follow, no story to tell. 
Instead, the GM is told to listen to the players and go where they want to go.
The GM is given a list of obstacles that they can throw at the players, as well as some ideas on when they might be good to throw in, but there's no set order, or even a mandate that the players must encounter certain obstacles&mdash;it's a [[Alexandrian--Dont-Prep-Plots#^90ab84|toolbox]] to use while GMing, not a script for your players to follow.

- [[Bissette--A-Dragon-Game|Chris Bissette's 'A Dragon Game']] is a terse tongue-and-cheek roll-under system that also emphasizes the idea that you shouldn't be rolling dice unless there are consequences.
- Lady Blackbird is the first one-shot in this settings, but Harper wrote 2 others: **Magister Lor** and **Lord Scurlock**. They are available for download at the same places as Lady Blackbird
- [[Harper--Lasers-And-Feelings|Lasers and Feelings]] is a simple one-page oneshot/adventure, also made by Harper. The system itself is very different from Lady Blackbird, and the starting plot is chosen by random table, but despite these differences, it likewise enforces the GM not prepare a plot ahead of time, and instead follow where the players and dice rolls lead.
