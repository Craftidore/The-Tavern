# The Bar

The Bar is where you start, and it's where you return. 
From here you can navigate to wherever you need to go.
We also keep the 'drinks' hereâ€”references that aren't their own note in the [[20-Bathroom-Library|Bathroom Library]] but still need explanation. 
Stuff like rule systems, people, general concepts, etc.

MoCs:
```dataview
TABLE link as Link FROM "10-The-Bar/11-MoCs" SORT file.name ASC
```
