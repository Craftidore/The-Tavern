This folder contains any MoCs (maps of content) for topics, sources, or relations. 
Most `type: source` notes should go here, as they'll serve as a MoC of all the notes concerning that source.
`type: category` notes should go here as well.

## What's a Map of Content

Maps of content are notes that serve as lists of links to other notes. 
They function a similar purpose as tags (i.e. they aren't exclusive; notes can be in more than 1 MoC), but unlike tags they are notes, which can have context and explanation around them.
